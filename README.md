# Rusty Player

Performance-oriented utility that wraps [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv) and [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) into a CLI solution to play Youtube audios (local files too).

Requires both **mpv** and **yt-dlp** on your **PATH**.

Nothing too fancy, I just don't want to launch a browser or any gui to listen to music and save some RAM while playing games.

## Controls
- **q**, quit
- **p**, pause
- **enter**, select
- **right arrow**, confirm/nextsong
- **left arrow**, go back/previous song
