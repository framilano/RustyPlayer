# Rusty Player

Performance-oriented utility that wraps [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv) and [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) into a CLI solution to play Youtube audios (local files too).

Requires both **mpv** and **yt-dlp** on your **PATH**.

If you want to enable KDE/GNOME integration, check [mpv-mpris](https://github.com/hoyon/mpv-mpris)

Nothing too fancy, I just don't want to launch a browser or any gui to listen to music and save some RAM while playing games. (Tbh, this is more a github actions test than else)
